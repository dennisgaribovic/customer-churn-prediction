# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction

A production-ready machine learning pipeline that predicts customer churn using structured banking data and interpretable models. This project simulates how financial institutions can **proactively identify at-risk customers**, reduce churn, and improve retention strategies — all through a modular, scalable, and explainable ML approach.

---

## 🎯 Business Context

Customer churn is one of the most costly challenges for subscription-based and financial businesses. Proactively identifying at-risk customers helps organizations:

- Reduce acquisition and retention costs  
- Personalize marketing and outreach campaigns  
- Gain insights into customer behavior patterns  
- Improve customer experience and satisfaction  

This project demonstrates a realistic, end-to-end churn prediction solution that can be integrated into CRM systems, dashboards, or customer success workflows.
